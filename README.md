Simple Keylogger
This project implements a basic keylogger for educational purposes, demonstrating fundamental concepts of input monitoring and file I/O in Python. It is designed strictly for learning and should only be used on your own devices with full awareness of its functionality.

Project Overview
The Simple Keylogger is a Python-based program that captures keyboard inputs and logs them to a file. This project serves as a practical exploration of:

Event handling in Python
File operations for logging data
Basic input monitoring techniques
Features
Captures keyboard presses
Logs keystrokes to a local file
Simple start/stop functionality
Educational Objectives
Understand the mechanics of input monitoring
Learn about event-driven programming
Explore file handling in Python
Gain insights into potential security vulnerabilities
Ethical Considerations
This project is created solely for educational purposes to understand the concepts behind keylogging. It is crucial to emphasize:
